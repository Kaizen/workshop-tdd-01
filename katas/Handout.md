# Unit Testing Ice Breakers

Not sure how to begin, or how to approach? Here are some ideas:

- Test that you can instantiate a class
- Test that you can call the method/function at all
- Pick the *easiest* bit of functionality
- Pick the most *interesting* bit of functionality
- Write the function name and assertion first
- Rename something
- Refactor existing tests
- Switch partners (with pair programming)
- Read the code for obvious flaws
- Rerun the AT


# Kata's
Some have been worked out here:

[StringCalculator Kata](StringCalculator.md)
[WordWrap Kata](WordWrap.md)

For a comprehensive list of all code kata's, [look here](https://codingdojo.org/kata/)

# Other
Reading a file, processing and dumping to a new file format is done using the [MTG Card Reader excercise](MTGCardReader/MTGCardReader.md)
