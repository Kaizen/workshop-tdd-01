# Number to LCD Kata
From: https://codingdojo.org/kata/NumberToLCD/

# Exercise

## Part 1

Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:
```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|  
 ```
(each digit is 3 lines high)

Note: Please do *NOT* read the second part before completing the first. 

Part of the purpose of this kata is to make you practice refactoring and adapting to changing requirements.

## Part 2

Change your program to support variable width or height of the digits. For example for width = 3 and height = 2 the digit 2 will be:

```
 ___
    |
    |
 ___
|
|
 ___

```


# Trivia
This is the inverse of the [Bank OCR Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR)

How would you deal with a "support additional display format" question? Ie, a graphical interface?
